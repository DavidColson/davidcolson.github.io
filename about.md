Hi my name is David Colson, I'm a game programmer and designer and I currently work at [Cloud Imperium Games](http://cloudimperiumgames.com/) on a massive space simulation game called [Star Citizen](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/). I designed and wrote the flight model for the spaceships in Star Citizen, and currently work on various other vehicle systems. This website is my personal site though where I write about my interests and side projects. 

Previously I worked on a failed little indie multiplayer game called [HitBox](https://store.steampowered.com/app/341890/HitBox/). In retrospect making an indie multiplayer game was a bad idea I recommend you don't do that. I studied Theoretical Physics at The National University of Ireland, Galway, and as this blog may indicate, maths and physics are still massive personal interests of mine.
